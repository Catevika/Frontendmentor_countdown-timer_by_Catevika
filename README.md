## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- **markup:** Semantic HTML5
- **styles:** CSS3
- **animation:** CSS3 + JavaScript

### What I learned

- CSS tricks to get a result as close as possible to the design recommendations
- Logic of a countdown timer with date and time
- CSS + JS card flip animation

### Useful resources

I would not have been able to create the flip javascript animation from scratch if I haven't found this amazing project. I updated the original to fit my markups in this project, added the "days" part, and it works like a charm!
